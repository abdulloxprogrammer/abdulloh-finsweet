                Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and
                sometimes we are unsure about how to <br />
                get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at
                Zeta Design wanted to build a Figma plugin <br />
                for the larger design community. The plugin is called the Ghost
                UXWriter and has a set of UX copies <br />
                cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone variation
                ranging from plain, casual to playful. The <br />
                intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium
                blog post, â€˜Designing voice and tone for <br />
                error messages.

                for your copy or look through the different categories of the
                copies <br> Step 4: Select the type of error you are looking for. You
                will get three different copies for each error <br> Step 5: Tap on
